# MakePlace Plugin

A plugin to automatically save and load housing furniture layouts for FFXIV. It can also import/export layouts from the [MakePlace](https://jawslouis.itch.io/makeplace) program since it uses the same file format.

## Installation

* You will need to use the [FFXIV Quick Launcher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) to run the game. This allows third-party plugins (such as this) to be used.
* Open the settings window by using the command `/xlsettings` in the chat, or by hitting `Esc` and selecting Dalamud Settings.
* Click on the "Experimental" tab
* Copy the following url into a new line on the Custom Plugin Repositories section: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jawslouis/MakePlacePlugin/master/MakePlacePlugin.json
  - For the CN server, use this version by BlueFissure: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bluefissure/MakePlacePlugin@cn/MakePlacePlugin.json
* Click on the `+` button. Make sure the new entry has "Enabled" checked.
* Click the "Save and Close" button
* Open the plugins window by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat, or hit `Esc` and select Dalamud Plugins
* Search for "MakePlace Plugin" and click "Install"

## Usage
Type `/makeplace` to open the plugin screen. Most functions are only available when in Rotate Furniture mode (Housing -> Indoor/Outdoor Furnishings. Click on the Rotate button).

* **Save**: Saves the *currently loaded* interior and exterior layout to file. You will need to load the interior/exterior layout before you can save it. Make sure the path contains the file name too (e.g. `save.json`)
* **Load**: Loads the layout from the specified file. The plugin will check the currently placed furniture in the house to see if there is a match with the layout. It also checks if there is a match for the dye color. All layout furniture with no match will be grayed out.
* **Get Interior/Exterior Layout**: Loads the current furniture layout in the house/yard. Interior and exterior layouts are loaded separately.
* **Apply Interior/Exterior Layout**: Applies the layout position to all applicable furniture in the house/yard (those that are not grayed out). **Furniture needs to be placed before it can be used in the layout** - items in the inventory or storeroom will not be used. Make sure that no furniture is selected before using this.
* **Time Interval**: The time period between each furniture placement when applying the entire layout. Setting this too low (e.g. 200ms) may cause some furniture placements to be missed. 
* **Label Furniture**: Shows a small tooltip over each furniture, with a button to apply the layout position to the furniture

### Saving a layout from the game
* Make sure you are in furniture mode
* Click on `Get Interior/Exterior Layout`
* Check the file path
  * Make sure the folder exists
  * Make sure the `save.json` file is specified. You can use any file name you want.
* Click on `Save`. Done!

### Loading a layout into the game
* Make sure you are in *rotate* furniture mode
* Make sure the file path points to your layout json file. It should end in `.json`
* Click on `Load`. Your layout should show up in the plugin
* Click on `Apply Interior Layout`. Sit back and wait for the placement to finish!

## FAQ
### Help! I can't get the plugin to work.
Create a github issue or post on the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/YuvcPzCuhq) for help with troubleshooting.

### Does the plugin work if the game is not in English?
Yes! Saving, loading, and transferring layouts will work in all languages.

### Can I use this to copy layouts from other houses?
No. You can only load layouts when in furniture layout mode, in your own house.

### Does the plugin use furniture from my inventory or storage?
It uses the furniture that is already placed in the house. It won't touch your inventory or storage, so there's no worries about messing up inventory management. Also, since placing furniture binds it and makes it untradeable, it's best that the player does it directly.

### Is it safe to use the plugin?
Since all third-party plugins are not in line with the game's terms of service, there is always an inherent risk. The plugin's automated furniture placement may also be detectable by the server as there is a very short interval between placing each furniture. You can increase the time interval between each furniture placement to reduce this risk.

Overall, I believe that the danger is low since SE focuses more on ToS violations that upset the game-balance (e.g. RMT). You can also reduce your risk by keeping a low profile and not mentioning the use of the plugin within the game. 

### How do I update the plugin?
When an update is available, simply return to the plugins window and click on the "Update Plugins" button.

### Why does the furniture snap back to the floor/wall after I apply a layout and exit the furnishing menu?
Items have a minimum float distance, below which they will snap back to the floor. Similarly, wall-mounted items have a minimum distance they need to be from a wall or partition, otherwise they will snap to it. Unfortunately, this is a game limitation and you will need to adjust your design.

If using the MakePlace app, you can enable `Minimum Float Distance` in settings to get a visual indicator when placing furniture.

### Why does the plugin crash sometimes when applying a layout?
Make sure your mouse cursor is not hovering over any item (even if the item is behind the plugin UI). When applying a layout, hovering over an item may cause some game code to conflict with the placement process. There is unfortunately no solution to this, since this is tied to how the game operates.

### I'm getting a Load Error
![Load Error](load-error.png?raw=true)

There was a recent update to the layout json format. Update the MakePlace App (not the plugin) to the latest version, and re-save the layout in the app while inside and outside. The json should now load in the plugin.

### The plugin says it's placing items but nothing is moving
You probably pressed `Get Interior Layout`, which loads the current layout in the game, instead of `Load`, which loads the layout from the file. Since the plugin is placing furniture that is already in position, it will look like nothing is moving.

## Credits
This plugin builds upon the foundation laid by 3 other great plugins: [HousingPos](https://github.com/Bluefissure/HousingPos), [BDTH](https://github.com/LeonBlade/BDTHPlugin) and [HouseMate](https://github.com/lmcintyre/Housemate). The UI in particular borrows heavily from HousingPos.
